# VEIZAC Design Backlog

## How to Use This Document

Each sprint produces a **shippable increment** — the site works end-to-end after every sprint.
Features list what to build. Acceptance criteria define "done." Spec refs point to the source of truth.
Status tracks progress: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done.
